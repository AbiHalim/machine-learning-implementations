# Neural Networks

Here, I am implementing the Perceptron, the basic building block of a Neural Network, and using it to create a Multi-Layer Neural Network.
Specifically, I implemented the Perceptron Learning Algorithm to create perceptrons which can model the decision boundaries of some basic logic gates, then combined them to model more complicated logic gates.
